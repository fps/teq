teq
===

A library implementing a jack midi client for sequencing purposes. The organization of the musical data is tracker-like, i.e. patterns with columns.


API Docs
========

The C++ API should be documented here: 

http://fps.github.com/teq

If you find these to be out of date, use

<code>
doxygen
</code>

to generate up to date documentation.

The Python API is generated from the file <code>python.cc</code>. So take a look at that file to see which functions and classes are exposed. Also take a look at <code>test_teq.py</code>. That file should serve as an example of how to use the API from a python program.
